vernacular
==========
Created during PennApps Fall 2014

Vernacular is a way to talk to real people fluent in a language while having a translator that wouldn't be readily available in our daily lives. When Moxtra introduced its API, we became inspired to combine it with Google Translate's API in order to create a singular webpage that could accomplish both goals at the same time.

Our targeted audience can vary between students learning a language, people wanting to practice an already learned language, and users that want to discuss world politics with people that are not necessarily fluent in a specified language.

We are especially proud of the creation of chat rooms for every language offered in Google Translate and the ability to highlight specific parts of text to get their direct translation.
