Created during PennApps Fall 2014

Vernacular is a web application that allows users to converse a foreign language in a supportive environment. Users can create chat rooms for every language that Google Translate offers, and within these chat rooms, they can talk directly with natives or other learning students. We also implemented the ability to translate any highlighted text to provide users with a seamless and painless experience.
